This project provides R scripts that downloads the latest PISA data (SAS files from the OECD website), reads it into R using the `{haven}` package, and filters the data specifically for Brunei. 
The processed CSV file is also provided for researchers interested in conducting analyses such as IRT and latent trait regression.

## Usage

If you would like to replicate the data processing steps, you can follow the instructions below.
Prerequisites:

- R (version 4.0 or higher recommended)
- R packages: `haven`, `tidyverse` (install them using `install.packages("haven")` and `install.packages("tidyverse")`)
- A stable internet connection!

Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pisabn.git
   ```

2. Open the project in RStudio or your preferred R environment.

3. Run the scripts in the `R/` directory in order, to initiate the download and processing of the PISA data.

## Data description

The PISA data is divided into several files, each containing different types of data. 
The data files are as follows:

1. `CY08MSP_CRT_COG` (Creative Thinking data)
2. `CY08MSP_FLT_COG` (Financial Literacy data)
3. `CY08MSP_FLT_QQQ` (Financial Literacy questionnaire data)
4. `CY08MSP_FLT_TIM` (Financial Literacy timing data)
5. `CY08MSP_SCH_QQQ` (School questionnaire data)
6. `CY08MSP_STU_COG` (Student cognitive item data)
7. `CY08MSP_STU_QQQ` (Student questionnaire data)
8. `CY08MSP_STU_TIM` (Student questionnaire timing data)
9. `CY08MSP_TCH_QQQ` (Teacher questionnaire data)
